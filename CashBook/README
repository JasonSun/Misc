This is a simple cross-platform personal financial tool written in Python.
It is used as a cash book for QiongQiong(my girlfriend). HAHA...

Feel free to download. Make sure you have python and wxPython installed.
$ python QYCashbook.py

Also you can transform python script into .exe file on Windows.
This is done by using py2exe utility.
1. Create a setup.py file
'''
setup.py
'''
from distutils.core import setup
import py2exe

setup = (
    windows = [QYCashbook.py],
    options = {
        'py2ext' : {
            'dll_excludes' : ['MSVCP90.dll']
        }
    }
)
